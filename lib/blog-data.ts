      <p class="mb-4">Property documentation in Nigeria is a critical aspect of real estate transactions. Understanding the various types of documents and their legal implications is essential to avoid fraud and ensure a secure investment.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Certificate of Occupancy (C of O)</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">The Certificate of Occupancy is a legal document issued by the State Governor to a land owner as a proof of ownership. It states that the land is owned by the individual for a period of 99 years. It is one of the most important documents to verify.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Survey Plan</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">A Survey Plan is a document that measures the land, shows its boundaries, and indicates its location. It is prepared by a registered surveyor and is crucial for identifying the exact plot of land you are purchasing.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Deed of Assignment</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">The Deed of Assignment is a legal document that transfers the ownership of a property from the seller (assignor) to the buyer (assignee). It contains details of the transaction, including the parties involved, the property description, and the consideration paid.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Governor's Consent</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Governor's Consent is required for any transfer of land ownership in Nigeria. This document confirms that the state government has approved the transfer of the property from one party to another.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Building Plan Approval</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">For developed properties, the Building Plan Approval shows that the structure was built according to approved architectural plans and meets local building codes and regulations.</p>
      
      <p class="mb-4 mt-6">Ensuring all these documents are authentic and properly registered is paramount for a safe property acquisition in Nigeria. Always verify documents through official channels and consider using professional verification services like PropertyVerifyNG.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">Property fraud is a significant concern in the Nigerian real estate market. Scammers often employ various tactics to deceive unsuspecting buyers. Being aware of these common scams can help you protect your investment.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">1. Fake Documents</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">One of the most common scams involves the creation of counterfeit property documents, such as fake Certificates of Occupancy or Deeds of Assignment. These documents can look very convincing to the untrained eye.</p>
      <p class="mb-4"><strong>How to avoid:</strong> Always verify documents with the relevant government agencies. Use professional verification services and never rely solely on photocopies.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">2. Selling Disputed Land</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Scammers may attempt to sell land that is subject to legal disputes, government acquisition, or family inheritance conflicts. The buyer may later discover they have no legal claim to the property.</p>
      <p class="mb-4"><strong>How to avoid:</strong> Conduct thorough due diligence, including physical inspection and inquiries with local authorities and community leaders.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">3. Impersonation</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Fraudsters might impersonate genuine property owners, agents, or even government officials. They may use fake identification or forge signatures on documents.</p>
      <p class="mb-4"><strong>How to avoid:</strong> Always meet the actual owner if possible, verify the identity of all parties involved, and insist on meeting at official locations.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">4. Double Allocation</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Some fraudsters sell the same piece of land to multiple buyers, collecting payments from each without any intention of delivering valid ownership.</p>
      <p class="mb-4"><strong>How to avoid:</strong> Verify that the seller is the legitimate owner and that the property hasn't been sold to others. Check with neighbors and local authorities.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">5. Advance Fee Fraud</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Scammers may request upfront payments for processing fees, documentation, or other services before showing the property or providing legitimate documents.</p>
      <p class="mb-4"><strong>How to avoid:</strong> Be wary of any requests for advance payments. Legitimate transactions should follow proper procedures with escrow services.</p>
      
      <p class="mb-4 mt-6">Using a trusted property verification platform like PropertyVerifyNG can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to these scams. Our comprehensive verification process helps ensure that you're making a safe and informed investment decision.</p>
